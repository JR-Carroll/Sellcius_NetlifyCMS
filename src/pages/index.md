  title: Who we are
  description: >
    We are a family - first, last, and everything in between.  


    Our goal is to provide a legacy for our little ones, connect other families together, and provide a fair, balanced, and transparent conversation between those in the market place.
description: All families need to make money!  A sometimes sad, and inescapable
  truth.  But, that doesn't mean we need to be taken advantage of, cheated, or
  denied the information to make informed decisions.  From our family to yours,
  we truely want to connect you with goods and services that you need and want
  and be part of your journey (whether you are the customer or the seller).

        on our platforms is premium (whether you are a casual browser, serious
        buyer/seller, or a paid premium user). Our tools help connect YOU with

        Marketing technology at it's finest. From the inception to "today", our
        team of marketing engineers is ramping up to continue to build more
        online properties that bring people together in the marketplace. Rest
        assured that one you see "today", won't be the same "tomorrow".

      text: "Our platforms and properties are built on a foundation of respect and
        trust. Our brand aims to make money - all companies do - but, we won't
        take advantage of the people that make up our networks and commerce -
        they are people too, with families, and just like our family we want the
        best for them and yours. "

  heading: Great coffee with no compromises
  description: >
    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
